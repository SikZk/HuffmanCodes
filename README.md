# My own implementation of Huffman coding algorithm in C

### Description
Huffman encoding provides the most efficient way to compress data, from a theoretical point of view. It is a lossless compression algorithm, which means that the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.

### How to use

### Resources
To understand the Huffman coding algorithm, I used the following resources:
